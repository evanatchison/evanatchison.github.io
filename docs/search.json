I hope to combine my two interests of history and data science to tell historical stories using data. Outside of my studies, I am a percussionist in both the St. Olaf Band and St. Olaf Orchetra.\n\n\nI am a passionate sports fan and I hope to translate this passion into the work I do on this website. While primarily a soccer fanatic, I also have great interest in basketball and football analytics. Using this passion, I love creating models that not only allow sports fans and executives to reflect on what has created sporting success in the past, but also what is predicted for the future of sports. Influenced by my love of history, I am also interested in political and population data that tells the stories of human migrations and changes in global political landscapes.\n\n\nWant to reach out?

    "text": "Analysis\nIn this map, we see that there is no clear correlation between median income and home ownership rates in a state. This is most visible in the juxtaposition of West Virginia, the state with the second-lowest median income but highest home ownership rate, and Minnesota, the state with the second-highest home ownership but a much higher median income. We can also see that lower-median income states like Mississippi and Maine have comparatively higher home ownership rates while California, New York, Massachusetts have much lower home ownership rates while simultaneously boasting high median incomes. With this, we can see that there may be other, more important factors that influence home ownership rates. New York and Massachusetts, two states with small land masses but booming economic centers, lack the size to accommodate adequate housing, meaning property prices are much higher and thus less desirable for aspiring homeowners. Furthermore, states on the West Coast have increasingly high standards of living, meaning property prices are undesirable and unaffordable for a large part of these states’ populations. But, in states such as Minnesota, West Virginia, and Michigan, lower housing prices allow for greater home ownership as a greater percentage of the population can afford property. This demonstrates that property prices and land mass are two variables with greater influence on home ownership."

    "text": "Introduction\nRecently, the state of Wisconsin announced the redrawing of its legislative maps after a decade of guaranteed Republican control of the state legislature. This control was due to extreme gerrymandering that made it impossible for Democrats to have control in the state legislature. But, with the redrawing of districts, Wisconsin hopes to create districts that better reflect the true voting habits of its voters. For this project, we will be revisiting the old district lines of Wisconsin to see just how gerrymandered the state was. With this, we can see the necessity for change in Wisconsin’s district lines and also the dangers of gerrymandering as a whole. To do this, we will use the data set results_house from the fec16 library along with a projection map of Wisconsin’s districts.\n\nresults_house &lt;- results_house |&gt;\n  mutate(district = parse_number(district_id)) |&gt;\n  group_by(state, district) |&gt;\n  summarize(candidates = n(),\n            total_votes = sum(general_votes, na.rm = TRUE),\n            d_votes = sum(ifelse(party == \"DEM\", general_votes, 0), na.rm = TRUE),\n    r_votes = sum(ifelse(party == \"REP\", general_votes, 0), na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\",\n    r_prop = r_votes/total_votes,\n    winner = ifelse(d_votes &gt; r_votes, \"Democrat\", \"Republican\"))\n\n\nwis_results &lt;- results_house |&gt;\n  filter(state == \"WI\") \n\n\nwis_merged &lt;- wis_dist |&gt;\n  st_transform(4326) |&gt;\n  inner_join(wis_results, by = c(\"DISTRICT\" = \"district\"))\nhead(wis_merged, width = Inf)\n\n\nwisconsin_map &lt;- ggplot(data = wis_merged, aes(fill = winner)) +\n  annotation_map_tile(zoom = 6, type = \"osm\", progress = \"none\") + \n  geom_sf(alpha = .75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Winner\", values = c(\"blue\", \"red\")) + \n  geom_sf_label(aes(label = DISTRICT), fill = \"white\") + \n  theme_void()\nwisconsin_map\n\nWarning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not\ngive correct results for longitude/latitude data\n\n\nLoading required namespace: raster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  wisconsin_map + \n  aes(fill = r_prop) + \n  scale_fill_distiller(\n    \"Proportion\\nRepublican\", \n    palette = \"RdBu\", \n    limits = c(0.2, 0.8))\n\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\nWarning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not\ngive correct results for longitude/latitude data"

    "text": "Analysis\nWith the overlay of the district on a map of Wisconsin, we can see how the gerrymandered lines operated. We can see this in the way lines were drawn in Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin’s two largest and most democratic cities. In Zone 4, we see how an incredibly dense part of Milwaukee’s population, a great majority of which are Democrat, is grouped into a tiny district. Because of this, the surrounding zones incorporating the Milwaukee area ensure Republicans have more power in their vote as a high concentration of Democratic voters find themselves in Zone 4 and not part of the other districts. Simiarlarly, Districts 2 and 3 employ similar strategies by clumping together a high volume of Democratic voters in Madison and Wisconsin’s western border into two districts to ensure easy wins for Democrats. With a majority of Democratic voters in only three districts, Wisconsin Republicans have, in essence, free paths to victory in the other five districts. Thus, the old district lines of Wisconsin ensured that the districts would always be 5 - 3 in favor of Republicans, a clear representation of the abuses of power gerrymandering can pose to the Democratic process. Wisconsin’s new districts lines provides hope for the future of the Democratic process in the state, which, as we can see in this map, has needed to change for a decade."
